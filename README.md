## About the Project

The Calorie Calculator is a web application that calculates your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** and provides estimates for daily calorie needs based on activity level. The project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to improve user input handling, DOM manipulation, and calculation-based logic.

This tool is particularly useful for individuals who want to monitor their calorie intake to maintain, lose, or gain weight.

## Key Features

- **User Input Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled out before performing calculations.
- **Dynamic BMR Calculation**: Calculates BMR using the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** for both males and females.
- **Activity-Based Calorie Estimates**: Provides calorie requirements for various activity levels:
  - Sedentary
  - Light Activity
  - Moderate Activity
  - Very Active
  - Extra Active
- **Clear & Reset Options**: Easily reset all inputs and outputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for seamless use on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic, input validation, and dynamic DOM updates.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Enhance my skills in DOM manipulation** by dynamically updating the UI based on user inputs.
2. **Implement input validation** to ensure accurate and error-free calculations.
3. **Integrate mathematical logic** (BMR formulas) with JavaScript to process user data and return results.
4. **Strengthen responsive design techniques** to improve user experience across devices.
5. **Apply clean coding practices** for better readability, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## How to Use

1. **Enter your details**: Age, gender, height (feet and inches), weight, and activity level.
2. **Click Calculate**: Get your BMR and calorie estimates.
3. **Clear**: Use the "Clear" button to reset all inputs.
4. **Reset**: Start over using the "Reset" button.

## Future Improvements

- **Unit Conversion**: Support for metric and imperial units (kg/cm vs. lbs/ft).
- **Interactive Chart**: Visualize calorie needs across activity levels.
- **Persistent Data**: Save user inputs locally using localStorage.
- **Accessibility**: Improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a toggle for dark/light themes.
